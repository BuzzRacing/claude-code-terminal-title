# Terminal Title Skill for Claude Code and Codex

Automatically update terminal window titles based on your current Claude Code or Codex task. Stop playing "which terminal is which?" with multiple AI coding sessions.

![Size](https://img.shields.io/badge/size-~2KB-blue)
![Platform](https://img.shields.io/badge/platform-macOS%20%7C%20Linux-lightgrey)

## Why This Exists

When running multiple Claude Code or Codex instances, terminal windows all look the same. You waste time clicking between tabs, trying to remember which session is handling what task.

This skill solves that by automatically updating your terminal title to reflect the current high-level task:

- `API Integration: Auth Flow`
- `Debug: Login Bug`
- `Build: Dashboard UI`
- `Test: Payment Module`

## Features

- ✅ **Zero Configuration** - Install and forget, works automatically
- 🤖 **AI-Powered** - Claude extracts task context from your prompts
- 🚀 **Lightweight** - 2KB package, no dependencies
- 🔄 **Automatic Updates** - Title changes when you switch tasks
- 🖥️ **Cross-Platform** - Works with iTerm2, Terminal, Alacritty, and more
- 📦 **Easy Distribution** - Single .skill file, standard installation

## Installation

### Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/bluzername/claude-code-terminal-title.git
cd claude-code-terminal-title

# Run the automated installer
chmod +x install-and-test.sh
./install-and-test.sh
```

The installer will:
- ✅ Check prerequisites
- ✅ Install the skill to `~/.claude/skills/`
- ✅ Set proper file permissions
- ✅ Run verification tests
- ✅ Provide next steps

### Alternative Installation Methods

**Claude Code CLI:**
```bash
claude-code install terminal-title.skill
```

**Codex + Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
.\install-codex-powershell.ps1
```

The PowerShell installer targets `~\.agents\skills` when present, matching Codex custom-skill installs on Windows. Use `-InstallDir "$env:USERPROFILE\.codex\skills"` if your Codex build loads custom skills directly from `~\.codex\skills`.

**Manual Install:**
```bash
mkdir -p ~/.claude/skills
unzip terminal-title.skill -d ~/.claude/skills/
chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/terminal-title/scripts/set_title.sh
```

### macOS Terminal.app Setup

For clean titles without suffixes, run:
```bash
chmod +x setup-zsh.sh
./setup-zsh.sh
```

### Uninstall

To remove the skill:
```bash
chmod +x uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh
```

## Usage

That's it! The skill works automatically when you use Claude Code or Codex.

### Examples

| Your Prompt | Terminal Title |
|------------|----------------|
| "Help me debug the authentication API" | `Debug: Auth API Flow` |
| "Create a React dashboard component" | `Build: Dashboard UI` |
| "Write tests for payment processing" | `Test: Payment Module` |
| "Optimize database queries" | `Optimize: DB Queries` |

### Optional Customization

Add a custom prefix to all terminal titles:

```bash
# Add to your ~/.bashrc, ~/.zshrc, or shell config:
export CLAUDE_TITLE_PREFIX="Claude"
export CODEX_TITLE_PREFIX="Codex"
```

**Result:** `Codex | my-project | Build: Dashboard UI`

This is perfect for:
- Distinguishing Claude terminals from other work
- Adding personality to your terminal titles
- Team environments where multiple people use Claude Code

## How It Works

1. You start Claude Code or Codex and give it a prompt
2. The skill analyzes your request and extracts the high-level task
3. It generates a concise title (max 40 characters)
4. Your terminal window title updates automatically
5. No interruption to your workflow

## Compatibility

### Fully Tested & Working ✅
- macOS Terminal.app + zsh (with setup-zsh.sh)
- iTerm2 (macOS)
- Windows Terminal + PowerShell
- Codex on Windows PowerShell

### Should Work (Community Testing Needed) ⚠️
- Alacritty, Kitty
- Linux: GNOME Terminal, Konsole, Terminator
- Windows Terminal + WSL

### Known Limitations ❌
- Plain bash without precmd support (titles won't persist)
- CMD without PowerShell script invocation
- Very old terminal emulators

### Session Behavior
When opening a new terminal within 5 minutes of setting a title, it may initially inherit the previous terminal's title. Once Claude Code runs and sets a new title in that terminal, each maintains its own title independently. This prevents stale titles while preserving active session titles.

### How the Skill Triggers

The skill automatically activates:
- At the start of every new Claude Code or Codex session (first prompt)
- When switching to a substantially different task (e.g., frontend → backend, debugging → new feature)

**Triggers on:**
- Moving from debugging to new feature development
- Changing from one module to a completely different one
- Starting work on a different part of the system

**Does NOT trigger for:**
- Follow-up questions on the same task ("Can you add a comment?")
- Small refinements ("Make it blue instead of red")
- Debugging the same feature you just built
- Clarifications or status updates

## Comparison with Existing Solutions

| Feature | Zsh Config Solution | This Skill |
|---------|-------------------|-----------|
| Installation | Manual shell config | One command |
| Task Detection | N/A | AI-powered |
| Shell Support | Zsh only | Any shell |
| Updates | Manual | Automatic |
| Learning Curve | Medium | None |

## Troubleshooting

### Terminal title not updating?

**Check installation:**
```bash
ls -la ~/.claude/skills/terminal-title/
```

**Test the script directly:**
```bash
cd ~/.claude/skills/terminal-title/
bash scripts/set_title.sh "Test: It Works!"
```

**Test Codex on Windows PowerShell:**
```powershell
& "$env:USERPROFILE\.agents\skills\terminal-title\scripts\set_title.ps1" "Test: It Works!"
```

**Verify permissions:**
```bash
chmod +x ~/.claude/skills/terminal-title/scripts/set_title.sh
```

### Still having issues?

1. Ensure your terminal supports ANSI escape sequences
2. Restart Claude Code or Codex after installation
3. Check the agent logs for errors
4. [Open an issue](../../issues) with details
